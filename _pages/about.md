Hello, and thank you for visiting my profile! I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, along with an honors program in AI & ML. My passion lies in harnessing the power of machine learning and AI to create impactful solutions for both commercial and everyday applications.

Throughout my academic journey, I have actively worked on several AI and ML projects, including large language models (LLMs) and business profitability analysis. My projects focus on analyzing data to derive meaningful insights, such as identifying opportunities to enhance profits and reduce losses through various data-driven techniques. I enjoy using machine learning models to provide visual representations of these insights and offer solutions to optimize business operations.

With a strong foundation in programming, web development, and data science, my technical skill set includes:

Programming Languages: Python (Proficient), C
Web Development: HTML, CSS, Django
Database Management: MySQL
Data Science: Machine Learning Algorithms (Regression, Classification, Clustering), Deep Learning (TensorFlow, Keras)
Data Structures & Algorithms: Basics.

In the future, I aim to become a successful AI and ML engineer, developing software solutions for industries and everyday users alike. My goal is to create AI-driven systems that enhance productivity, improve decision-making, and streamline daily tasks, making life more efficient for businesses and individuals.
