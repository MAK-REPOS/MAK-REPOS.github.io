Hello, and thank you for visiting my profile! I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, along with an honors program in AI & ML. My passion lies in harnessing the power of machine learning and AI to create impactful solutions for both commercial and everyday applications.

Throughout my academic journey, I have actively worked on several AI and ML projects, including large language models (LLMs) and business profitability analysis. My projects focus on analyzing data to derive meaningful insights, such as identifying opportunities to enhance profits and reduce losses through various data-driven techniques. I enjoy using machine learning models to provide visual representations of these insights and offer solutions to optimize business operations.

I am particularly excited about contributing to organizations that lead innovation in AI, machine learning, and data science. With a strong interest in the integration of AI-powered solutions for automation and optimization, I am keen to work on projects that align with  technological growth, such as smart home automation systems and AI-driven surveillance.

In the future, I aspire to become a successful AI and ML engineer, designing cutting-edge software solutions for both industrial applications and broader consumer markets alike. My objective is to develop AI-powered systems that boost operational efficiency, enhance data-driven decision-making, and automate routine tasks, ultimately driving productivity and elevating the quality of life for businesses and individuals alike.
