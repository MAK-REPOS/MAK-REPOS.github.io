Hello, and thank you for visiting my profile! I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, along with an honors program in AI & ML. My passion lies in harnessing the power of machine learning and AI to create impactful solutions for both commercial and everyday applications.

Throughout my academic journey, I have actively worked on several AI and ML projects, with my most significant project being an LLM-based cold email generator. This project focuses on automatingg the process generating personalized cold emails for service companies, showcasing my expertise in utilizing large language models (LLMs) to solve real-world business problems. Alongside this, I have also worked on business profitability analysis, where I analyze data to derive insights that enhance profits and reduce losses through various data-driven techniques. Using machine learning models, I create visual representations of these insights to optimize business operations efficiently.


I am particularly excited about contributing to organizations that lead innovation in AI, machine learning, and data science. With a strong interest in the integration of AI-powered solutions for automation and optimization, I am keen to work on projects that align with  technological growth, such as smart home automation systems and AI-driven surveillance.

In the future, I aspire to become a successful AI and ML engineer, designing cutting-edge software solutions for both industrial applications and broader consumer markets alike. My objective is to develop AI-powered systems that boost operational efficiency, enhance data-driven decision-making, and automate routine tasks, ultimately driving productivity and elevating the quality of life for businesses and individuals alike.
